## üö® Critical Security Findings (Immediate Action Required)

### [VULN-001] Unrestricted RDP Access
- **Sources:** Gemini/Prowler/Both
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Risk Score:** 10/10
- **Configuration Issue:**
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_rdp" {
  allow {
    ports    = ["3389"]
    protocol = "tcp"
  }
  description   = "Allow RDP from anywhere"
  direction     = "INGRESS"
  name          = "default-allow-rdp"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"
  priority      = 65534
  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
- **Attack Vector:** Attackers can attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in RDP services to gain unauthorized access to instances.
- **Business Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected instances, data theft, malware installation, and use of the instances for malicious activities. Estimated cost of a data breach: $4.45 million (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023).
- **Evidence:** Gemini analysis identified the unrestricted source range. Prowler confirmed the exposure of port 3389 to the internet.
- **Remediation Steps:**
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_rdp" {
  allow {
    ports    = ["3389"]
    protocol = "tcp"
  }
  description   = "Allow RDP from specific IP ranges"
  direction     = "INGRESS"
  name          = "default-allow-rdp"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"
  priority      = 65534
  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  source_ranges = ["<YOUR_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>", "<ANOTHER_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>"]
}
```
  1. Replace `<YOUR_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>` and `<ANOTHER_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>` with the specific IP ranges that require RDP access.
  2. Apply the updated Terraform configuration.
- **Timeline:** Immediate (0-24 hours)
- **Validation:**
  1. Verify that RDP access is only possible from the specified IP ranges.
  2. Attempt to connect to the RDP port from an unauthorized IP address and confirm that the connection is blocked.

  name          = "default-allow-ssh"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"
  priority      = 65534
  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
- **Attack Vector:** Attackers can attempt brute-force attacks or exploit known vulnerabilities in SSH services to gain unauthorized access to instances.
- **Business Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected instances, data theft, malware installation, and use of the instances for malicious activities. Estimated cost of a data breach: $4.45 million (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023).
- **Evidence:** Gemini analysis identified the unrestricted source range. Prowler confirmed the exposure of port 22 to the internet.
- **Remediation Steps:**
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_ssh" {
  allow {
    ports    = ["22"]
    protocol = "tcp"
  }
  description   = "Allow SSH from specific IP ranges"
  direction     = "INGRESS"
  name          = "default-allow-ssh"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"

  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  source_ranges = ["<YOUR_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>", "<ANOTHER_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>"]
}
```
  1. Replace `<YOUR_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>` and `<ANOTHER_TRUSTED_IP_RANGE>` with the specific IP ranges that require SSH access. Consider using a bastion host for SSH access.
