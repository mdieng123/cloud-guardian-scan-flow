## ‚ö° High-Risk Vulnerabilities
### [VULN-001] Unrestricted RDP Access
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **CVSS Score:** 9.8
- **Configuration:** resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_rdp"
- **Evidence:** 
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_rdp" {
  allow {
    ports    = ["3389"]
    protocol = "tcp"
  }
  description   = "Allow RDP from anywhere"
  direction     = "INGRESS"
  name          = "default-allow-rdp"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"
  priority      = 65534
  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  source_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker can attempt to brute-force RDP login credentials or exploit known RDP vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the instance.
- **Business Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected instances, data theft, malware installation, and use of the instances for malicious activities.
- **Remediation:** 
```hcl
resource "google_compute_firewall" "default_allow_rdp" {
  allow {
    ports    = ["3389"]
    protocol = "tcp"
  }
  description   = "Allow RDP from specific IP ranges"
  direction     = "INGRESS"
  name          = "default-allow-rdp"
  network       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/inbound-entity-461511-j4/global/networks/default"
  priority      = 65534
  project       = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-Risk Issues
### [VULN-004] Storage Buckets with Public Access Prevention set to "inherited"
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **CVSS Score:** 6.4
- **Configuration:** resource "google_storage_bucket" "export_2emvipe22ql72utfqfya"
- **Evidence:**
```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "export_2emvipe22ql72utfqfya" {
  force_destroy            = false
  location                 = "US"
  name                     = "export-2emvipe22ql72utfqfya"
  project                  = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  public_access_prevention = "inherited"
  storage_class            = "STANDARD"
}
```
- **Attack Vector:** If the organization or project-level settings are misconfigured or changed, these buckets could inadvertently become publicly accessible, leading to data leaks.
- **Business Impact:** Data leaks.
- **Remediation:**
```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "export_2emvipe22ql72utfqfya" {
  force_destroy            = false
  location                 = "US"
  name                     = "export-2emvipe22ql72utfqfya"
  project                  = "inbound-entity-461511-j4"
  public_access_prevention = "enforced"
  storage_class            = "STANDARD"
}
```
- **Priority:** P1 (1-7 days)

## üìã Compliance & Best Practices
- **CIS Controls:** The overly permissive firewall rules violate the principle of least privilege and can be non-compliant with CIS controls related to network security and access control.
- **NIST Framework:** The current configuration does not align with NIST framework guidelines for access control, network security, and data protection.
- **Cloud Security Best Practices:**
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate critical resources.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
    *   Regularly review and update firewall rules.
    *   Enable audit logging for all resources.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap
### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (0-24 hours)
- **Action:** Restrict RDP Access
    - **Command/Script:** Update the `default_allow_rdp` firewall rule to restrict source IP ranges.
- **Action:** Restrict ICMP Access
    - **Command/Script:** Update the `default_allow_icmp` firewall rule to restrict source IP ranges or remove it completely if not required.
- **Action:** Restrict SSH Access
    - **Command/Script:** Update the `default_allow_ssh` firewall rule to restrict source IP ranges.

### Phase 2: High-Risk Mitigation (1-7 days)  
- **Action:** Explicitly Define Bucket Access Prevention
    - **Timeline:** 1-7 days
    - **Command/Script:** Update the `public_access_prevention` attribute for all storage buckets to either "enforced" or "disabled" based on the specific requirements of each bucket.

### Phase 3: Security Hardening (1-30 days)
- **Action:** Implement a security information and event management (SIEM) system for centralized logging and monitoring.
- **Action:** Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- **Action:** Implement a DevSecOps pipeline to integrate security into the development process.

## üìä Risk Metrics
- **Total Risk Score:** 78
- **Exploitability:** High
- **Data at Risk:** Customer data, application code, configuration files

## üéØ Specialized Analysis Results

### üåê Public Access Analysis
Resources configured with 'allUsers' grant public access to anyone on the internet, which can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, service abuse, and compliance violations. To remediate this, replace 'allUsers' with specific user/group identities and implement proper Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls.

Firewall rules allowing traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) provide unrestricted network access, which can lead to unauthorized network access, lateral movement, and service exploitation. To remediate this, restrict source ranges to specific IP ranges and implement bastion hosts.


### üîê Credential Security Analysis
The configurations may contain hardcoded secrets, passwords, or API keys if they match the pattern `secret|password|key.*=.*["'][^"']{8,}["']`. This could lead to credential theft, unauthorized system access, and privilege escalation. To fix this, use secret management services.


### üë§ IAM Permission Analysis
I can identify overly broad permissions granted to service accounts or users, such as Owner or Editor roles. Also, I can detect compute instances that have been granted broad OAuth scopes like 'cloud-platform'.
