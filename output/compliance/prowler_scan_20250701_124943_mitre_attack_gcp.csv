gcp;MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.;inbound-entity-461511-j4;2025-07-01 12:49:44.280256;T1525;Implant Internal Image;Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Unlike Upload Malware, this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.;Persistence;;IaaS | Containers;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525/;AnthosConfigManagement, AnthosConfigManagement, Artifact Registry, Binary Authorization, Container Registry, Google Kubernetes Engine, Security Command Center;Detect, Protect, Protect, Protect, Protect, Detect, Detect;Partial, Partial, Partial, Significant, Partial, Partial, Significant;, Prevent configuration drift with continuous monitoring of your cluster state, using the declarative model to apply policies that enforce compliance. This control can periodically check the integrity of images and containers used in cloud deployments to ensure that adversaries cannot implant malicious code to gain access to an environment., Once this control is deployed, it can detect known vulnerabilities in Docker containers. This information can be used to detect malicious implanted images in the environment. This control does not directly protect against exploitation., Each image has a signer digitally sign using a private key. At deploy time, the enforcer uses the attester's public key to verify the signature in the attestation., Using Container Analysis and Vulnerability scanning, this security solution can detect known vulnerabilities in Docker containers. This information can be used to detect images that deviate from the baseline norm, and could indicate a malicious implanted images in the environment. Due to the medium threat detection coverage and temporal factor, the control was scored as partial., After scanning for vulnerabilities, this control may alert personnel of tampered container images that could be running in a Kubernetes cluster., SCC is able to detect modifications that were not not part of the original container image. Because of the high threat detection coverage and near-real time temporal factor this control was graded as significant.;PASS;AR Container Analysis is enabled in project inbound-entity-461511-j4.;containeranalysis.googleapis.com;artifacts_container_analysis_enabled;False;AR Container Analysis;global

However, Actifio only encrypts data in transit that interacts with Actifio components, rather than all traffic for a system. This is also only relevant when traffic is being backed up, which is a small amount of the time.

This control may be used to ensure that permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services., Adversaries that try to disable cloud logging capabilities have the advantage to limit the amount of the data that can be collected and can possibly control not being detected. This control may be used to routinely check role account permissions in IAM audit logs., An adversary may disable cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. GCP allows configuration of account policies to enable logging and IAM permissions and roles to determine your ability to access audit logs data in Google Cloud resources., This control adopts the security principle of least privilege, which grants necessary access to user's resources when justified and needed.
